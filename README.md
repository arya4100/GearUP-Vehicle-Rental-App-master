# GearUP — Vehicle Rental App  

## 👥 Team Members & Folder Structure  

This repository is organized so each team member has their own dedicated folder for development.  
This structure avoids merge conflicts and keeps everyone’s work organized before integration.

├── avi/ → Avi’s components and UI pages (e.g., Search Page, Firebase setup)
│
├── anku/ → Anku’s components (e.g., Register Page, styling updates)

### 🧭 Collaboration Rules
- Each member works **only in their folder** to avoid merge conflicts.  
- Shared files (like configs or constants) go into the `shared/` folder.  
- Before editing anything in `shared/`, inform the group in Teams.  
- Regularly run `git pull` to stay updated with other members’ changes.
